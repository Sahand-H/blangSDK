Summary [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UBC-Stat-ML/blangSDK.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UBC-Stat-ML/blangSDK) 
-------

**Prospective/current users**: please vist the [project web page](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/blang/index.html) for more information.

**Blang developers**: in addition to the above resources, see also the [documentation repository](https://github.com/UBC-Stat-ML/blangDoc) for more information.

This is one of the repositories hosting Blang's code. This one contains the Blang's SDK (Software Development Kit), including:

- Basic datatypes suitable for sampling such as ``Real``, ``Int``, ``Simplex``, etc.
- Inference algorithms for such datatypes, such as Sequential Change of Measure and Adaptive Non-Reversible Parallel Tempering.
- Standard probability distributions.
- Examples.

See [this readme](https://github.com/UBC-Stat-ML/blangDoc/blob/master/README.md) for a roadmap of the other key repositories (language infrastructure, examples, supporting libraries, etc)
